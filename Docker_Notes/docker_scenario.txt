You start by creating a Docker image using the openjdk:11 base image, as it includes the Java runtime environment and seems like a logical choice. However, you soon realize that this image also includes unnecessary packages and tools, bloating the image size and potentially increasing the attack surface. How can you avoid including unnecessary components in your Docker image while ensuring that it remains secure and efficient?
 
 💡 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: You can use a distroless base image for your Java application, such as gcr.io/distroless/java, which includes only the Java runtime and necessary libraries. This approach results in a smaller, more secure image that is fitting to your application's needs.

 🤔 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬?
Distroless images are Docker images that contain only the necessary dependencies to run your application, without including a full Linux distribution or package manager. They are designed to be lean, secure, and optimized for specific use cases.

 🌟 𝐁𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭𝐬:
𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲: Distroless images are smaller in size, leading to faster container startup times and more efficient use of resources.
𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲: By reducing the attack surface, distroless images improve the security posture of your application.

 🗝️ Using distroless images in your Docker workflow can significantly optimize your containerized applications.
